            <h4>Reel Analytics is a sports technology and data company that analyzes video to measure athleticism for
              coaches to evaluate players more accurately.</h4>
            <p>Although the modern-day athlete is bigger and more athletic than ever before, there hasn't been a change
              in the way athleticism is measured since the early 1900s. As a result, the same tools used to measure
              athleticism in the 1900s yielded poor player evaluation results today. 67% of players recruited or drafted
              by teams are not evaluated accurately, resulting in an 18 billion dollar loss in salary, scholarships, and
              financial aid annually. In fact, more than 70% of NFL rookies will not sign a second contract.</p>
            <div class="article__double">
              <p>At Reel Analytics we’ve solved this problem by moving beyond the stopwatch, the tape measure and the
                scale using our technology to unlock new athletic data from video.</p>
              <p>With our position-specific in-game athleticism metrics, teams can more accurately evaluate the athletic
                ability of players they're recruiting.</p>
